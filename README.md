# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

#Technologies used:
Reactjs, a Javascript library for creating highly interactive user interface web applications.
In react, we used "useState" hook for creating, tracking and updating a state in the components, like inputing the todos, keeping track of them through onChange in the input and updating the value as it changes. Similarly for the list of todos, when we submit the form, the useState updates the list of todos
html, css and javascript
In css, flex layout is used.

#Components
In this todo list, a component newTodo used for inputing the todo using form submission
A todo list component for all the todos being added
And an edit todo for editing an existing todo using form submission

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
